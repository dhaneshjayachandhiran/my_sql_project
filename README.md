# 🗄️ My SQL Project

Welcome to my SQL playground! 🎉  
Here, I upload problems, try out solutions, and sharpen my database skills one query at a time.  
Think of this repo as my journey to becoming a **SQL ninja** 🥷✨.

## 📂 What’s Inside?
- 📘 SQL problems I’ve practiced  
- 📝 Query solutions (with trial & error 😅)

##💡 Fun Fact
Every query here is a little puzzle piece 🧩. The more I solve, the clearer the bigger picture of data mastery becomes.

🌱 Keep Growing
This repo isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress.
- Breaking queries, fixing them, and learning along the way.
- Because at the end of the day:

"Great databases aren’t built in a day, but built one query at a time." ⚡
